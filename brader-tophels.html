                <p>Hi Brader Tophels!</p>
                
                <p>This might sound corny—writing a letter for each one of you—but this is my way of thanking you for an awesome co-TL partnership. When you stepped into the TL scene, you really gave it your all. You pushed yourself to learn new things, endured the pains and struggles, and I've seen it all. The jokes we shared will always stay in my heart.</p>
                
                <p>I truly appreciate how you helped my team during times of need. Those small and big moves never went unnoticed—you really are a true leader. You always help me understand things, even when I don't understand them at all 😂.</p>
                
                <p>I also admire what you're doing for your family—raising them for their future and being a responsible provider. I honestly hope I can be the same one day as well.</p>
                
                <p>Brader, if you ever doubt yourself, always remember how far you've come. You've made a difference both at work and in your personal life. You're the skinny version of me 😂, but seriously—you're a leader who's willing to do whatever it takes to achieve the goal. Stay true. Stay kind.</p>
                
                <p>I really wish we could still be workmates in the long run, but destiny seems to have pointed me in a different direction. For now, as long as we are workmates, I truly appreciate your presence. Keep pushing toward your dreams, brader—I'm here to support you.</p>
                
                <p>Even if our philosophies may differ, always remember that I am proud of you. Always.</p>
                
                <p>Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, brader!</p>
