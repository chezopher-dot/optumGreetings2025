                <p>Hi DM! Merry Christmas and Happy New Year!</p>
                
                <p>I'll be going digital with this letter since it's more efficient. When you came into our lives under USP, you truly made a huge impact—not just on our performance, but on us as individuals. You helped us grow in how we manage people and how we stand as leaders.</p>
                
                <p>It wasn't easy, but you never gave up on us. You continuously honed our skills and pushed us to become the best versions of ourselves. Thank you for helping me unlock the last missing pieces of myself as a TL—especially in handling difficult conversations. As a people-pleaser, I always feared offending others, but you helped me realize that leadership isn't always about delivering good news. Sometimes, we need to deliver tough messages and stand by them.</p>
                
                <p>I truly appreciate all your teachings. Even when things were hard for me to understand, you always made time to explain and ensured that I improved moving forward. I hope you continue being the awesome manager that you are—you're truly one of a kind. A rare and invaluable friend, someone you can always lean on.</p>
                
                <p>Throughout my entire stay at Optum, you showed me both sides of the world. I honestly wish we had more years to work together, but life happens, and growth calls us forward. Still, no beef at all—I genuinely mean it. I deeply cherish your guidance and support. You're like a big brother… or step sister—ahaha!</p>
                
                <p>All your achievements and recognitions are truly well-deserved. Stay awesome, DM, and please stay true—now and forever. Even if our philosophies differ, always remember that I am always proud of you.</p>
                
                <p>Merry Christmas and have a wonderful New Year!<br>God bless!</p>
