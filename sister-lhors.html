                <p>Hi Lhor!</p>
                
                <p>I would like to write you a short letter to express how thankful I am that we were able to work together. I've seen your growth from agent to supervisor, and what you've accomplished today is something you planted years back.</p>
                
                <p>If you ever doubt yourself, don't—because you've come this far and have truly made a difference. Trust yourself and never lose hope. I really admire your work commitment and strong work ethic. I can already see you growing into a better version of me, and I honestly hope and wish that one day you'll surpass us all and become a DM or even an SDM 😂.</p>
                
                <p>From now on, I don't think I can teach you anything new—you already have the skills and wisdom to adapt to any situation. But if you ever need someone to talk to, I'm always here to listen. I also truly appreciate you for helping my team during times of need.</p>
                
                <p>I hope you continue to grow and chase your dreams. I'm confident that USP Small Business is in good hands—char, OA 😂.</p>
                
                <p>Anyway, have a wonderful Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!<br>Stay awesome, Lhor. Stay awesome 🙂</p>
